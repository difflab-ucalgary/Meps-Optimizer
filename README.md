# Interactive Optimizer for Generating Electro-Physiological Sensors

This Interactive Optimizer generates sensor encapsulating electrodes which can sense EMG (Electromyogram), EDA (Electro-Dermal Activity) and
ECG (Electrocardiogram) signals.

## Instructions for Use
- The tool needs absolute physical dimensions for generating sensors that are tailored for individual body dimensions. Hence the canvas has been designed keeping in mind the absolute human forearm dimensions.
- The browser window needs to be set to around 50-75% zoom levels to ensure that all the panels and the SVG canvas are appropriately rendered without overlaps.
